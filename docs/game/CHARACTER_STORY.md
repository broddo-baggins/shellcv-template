**Support says:**

### The Challenge

Despite all your skills, the corporate world is brutal:

**The Pressure**
- Customers demanding features
- Sales promising impossible timelines
- Engineering pushing back on scope
- Executives wanting faster results
- Competitors moving quickly
- Market conditions changing
- Budget constraints tightening

**The Conflicts**
- Feature A vs Feature B (both "critical")
- Speed vs Quality (always tension)
- Build vs Buy (resources limited)
- Innovation vs Technical Debt (never enough time)
- Customer requests vs Product vision (who to listen to?)

**The Burnout Risk**
Every day is a battle of:
- Energy management (meetings drain you)
- Credibility building (ship or lose influence)
- Resource allocation (budget is never enough)
- Team morale (they feel the pressure too)

**Can you make it to CPO?**

The path is clear but treacherous:
1. Associate PM → Prove you can ship
2. PM → Own a product
3. Senior PM → Drive strategy
4. Lead PM → Lead multiple products
5. Director → Build teams
6. VP → Shape company
7. CPO → Master the system

Every level brings new challenges. Every decision has trade-offs. Every stakeholder wants something different.

### Your Philosophy

**"Ship fast, measure everything, iterate relentlessly."**

You believe in:
- **Speed** - Velocity is a feature
- **Data** - Intuition informed by metrics
- **Users** - Talk to them weekly
- **Quality** - Done right > done fast
- **Transparency** - Share the roadmap
- **Ownership** - You own outcomes
- **Learning** - Every failure teaches
- **Execution** - Strategy without execution is hallucination

### The Journey Ahead

You're starting as an Associate PM, but you have the skills of a VP. The question isn't whether you know enough - it's whether you can navigate the politics, manage the pressure, and make the right calls when it matters.

**This is your story. This is PM Quest.**

Welcome to the corporate climb. Let's see if you can make it to the top without burning out.
