### [OK] Q2: Out-of-Scope Questions

**Status:** Implemented with clear boundaries

**What HAL-PM CAN answer:**
- Career & portfolio
- Technical skills
- PM frameworks & methodologies

- Off-topic requests

**Example declination:**
```
User: "What should I eat for dinner?"

HAL-PM: "I'm afraid that query is outside my operational scope. 
I specialize in career data, technical competencies, and product 
management topics. Execute 'help' to view available information domains."
```

---

### [OK] Q3: Role Matching

**Status:** Implemented (context-based, no web search yet)

When user provides job description:
- Analyzes requirements
- Matches against verified experience
- Provides specific examples with metrics
- Cites multiple relevant roles

**Example:**
```
User: "Why would Amit be a good fit for a Senior PM at a cybersecurity startup?"

HAL-PM: "I have analyzed the role requirements:

Cybersecurity Expertise:
- 4+ years at SentinelOne (EPP/EDR/XDR)
- Director at McAfee (DLP, Endpoint Protection)
- Deep knowledge: MITRE ATT&CK, security testing

Startup Experience:
- Founded OvenAI (0→MVP→pilot)
- Founded DeepWaters (0→150K community)

Senior PM Skills:
- Led 30 engineers
- Data-driven (OKRs, KPIs)

```

---

### [OK] Q4: Session Context

- Automatic cleanup every 10 minutes

**Usage:**
```javascript
await agent.ask("Tell me about SentinelOne", "user-123");

// [OK] HAL-PM knows "achievements" refers to SentinelOne
```

---

### [OK] Q5: Multi-Tenant / RLS

---

##  Technical Changes

### ai-agent.js Enhancements

**1. Full Resume Integration**
```javascript
// Before: High-level summary only
"SentinelOne: Enterprise cybersecurity product development"

// After: Detailed achievements
"SentinelOne (2016-2020) - Group Lead, MacOS & Linux QA
- Team Leadership: Led teams, 0% to 100% automated coverage
- Automation: 5,000+ test cases to automated pipelines
- Product Owner: Device Control, Network Control, EDR
- Recognition: Industry-leading rankings (4 years)
- Beta Program: 45 enterprise customers"
```

**2. Session Context Management**
```javascript
// New features
this.sessions = new Map();
this.sessionTimeout = 30 * 60 * 1000; // 30 minutes
this.maxContextMessages = 5;

getSessionContext(sessionId)
addToHistory(sessionId, role, content)
buildContextPrompt(sessionId)
clearSession(sessionId)
```

**3. Enhanced Security**
```javascript
// Phone protection - highest priority
if (q.includes('phone') || q.includes('telephone') || q.includes('call')) {
    return "I'm afraid phone numbers are not available...";
}
```

**4. Process Exit Fix**
```javascript
// Before: Hanging
setInterval(() => this.cleanupExpiredSessions(), 10 * 60 * 1000);

// After: Clean exit
this.cleanupInterval = setInterval(...);
this.cleanupInterval.unref(); // Don't block exit
```

**5. Enhanced Fallback Responses**
```javascript
// Now includes specific achievements and metrics
// Company-specific responses (OvenAI, SentinelOne, McAfee, etc.)
// Role matching analysis
// ASCII art capability acknowledgment
```

##  Documentation Changes

### Consolidated Documentation

**Before:**
- HAL-PM_QUICK_START.md
- HAL-PM_SYSTEM_DOCUMENTATION.md
- HAL-PM_TRANSFORMATION_SUMMARY.md
- HAL-PM_CAPABILITIES_ANALYSIS.md

**After:**
- **HAL-PM_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md** (single comprehensive guide)
- HAL-PM_V2_RELEASE_NOTES.md (this file)
- DOCUMENTATION_STATUS.md (project-wide status)

**Benefits:**
- Single source of truth
- No duplicate information
- Easier to maintain
- Complete reference in one place

---

##  Bug Fixes

### Fixed: Script Hanging Issue

**Problem:** Test scripts would hang and never exit

**Cause:** `setInterval` in constructor kept event loop alive

**Solution:**
```javascript
this.cleanupInterval.unref(); // Allow process to exit
```

**Test:**
```bash
# Before: Hangs forever
node test-hal-pm.js

# After: Exits cleanly
node test-hal-pm.js
[OK] Test completed successfully
```

---

### Fixed: .env Not Loading in Tests

**Problem:** Test script couldn't load API key from .env

**Cause:** Missing `require('dotenv').config()`

**Solution:**
```javascript
// Added to test-hal-pm.js
require('dotenv').config();
```

**Test:**
```bash
node test-hal-pm.js
Mode: AI-powered  # [OK] API key loaded
```

##  Deployment

### No Breaking Changes

HAL-PM v2.0.0 is **backward compatible** with v1.0.0 integrations.

### Migration Steps

1. **Update `ai-agent.js`** - New version already in place
2. **No .env changes needed** - Same API key format
3. **Update documentation references** - Point to `HAL-PM_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md`
4. **Test thoroughly** - Run `test-hal-pm.js`

### Optional: Session ID Integration

If using server.js, optionally pass session IDs:

```javascript
// Before
const answer = await agent.ask(question);

// After (optional)
const sessionId = req.cookies.sessionId || 'default';
const answer = await agent.ask(question, sessionId);
```

---

##  Usage Examples

### Basic Query
```javascript
const agent = getAIAgent();
const answer = await agent.ask("What did Amit do at SentinelOne?");
```

### With Context
```javascript
await agent.ask("Tell me about OvenAI", "user-123");
await agent.ask("What were the key metrics?", "user-123"); // Has context
```

### Role Matching
```javascript
const jobDesc = `
Senior PM at cybersecurity startup
Requirements: PM experience, security domain, startup background
`;
const fit = await agent.ask(`Why would Amit fit this role: ${jobDesc}`);
```

### System Status
```javascript
const status = agent.getSystemStatus();
console.log(status.mode); // "AI-powered" or "Fallback"
console.log(status.features.phoneProtection); // true
```

---

##  Security

### Enhanced Privacy Protection

1. **Phone Number:** Explicit first-priority protection
