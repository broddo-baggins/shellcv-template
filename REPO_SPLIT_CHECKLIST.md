This is your step-by-step guide to split your current repository into two: a public template and your private personal site.

## Pre-Split Checklist

- [x] Updated `server.js` with template placeholders
- [x] Created `README.template.md` with template instructions
- [x] Created `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` with deployment instructions
- [x] Created this checklist

### ðŸ”„ Your Tasks Before Split

- [ ] Review all changes made by AI agent
- [ ] Test locally to ensure everything still works:
  ```bash
  npm start
  # Test in browser: http://localhost:3333
  # Test with curl: curl localhost:3333
  ```
- [ ] Verify your personal `assets/resume.txt`, `assets/skills.txt`, `assets/projects.txt` still exist
- [ ] Verify your personal `ai-agent.js` still exists with your real data
- [ ] Commit all current changes to your current repo:
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "PREPARE: Repository split preparation"
  git push
  ```

## Split Process

###  Part 1: Create Public Template Repository

1. **Clone current repo to new location:**
   ```bash
   cd ~/projects
   git clone https://github.com/broddo-baggins/ShellCV.git shellcv-template
   cd shellcv-template
   ```

2. **Remove personal data files:**
   ```bash
   # These should already be in .gitignore, but remove from git history
   git rm --cached assets/resume.txt assets/skills.txt assets/projects.txt
   git rm --cached ai-agent.js
   rm assets/resume.txt assets/skills.txt assets/projects.txt
   rm ai-agent.js
   ```

3. **Rename template files to main files:**
   ```bash
   mv README.template.md README.md
   mv ai-agent.template.js ai-agent.js
   ```

4. **Remove .git directory and reinitialize:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf .git
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "INIT: ShellCV Template v2.0.0 - Public template with no personal data"
   ```

5. **Create new GitHub repository:**
   - Go to github.com
   - Create new repository: `shellcv-template`
   - Make it **PUBLIC**
   - Don't initialize with README

6. **Push to new repository:**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/shellcv-template.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

7. **Verify template repo:**
   - [ ] Check GitHub - no personal data visible
   - [ ] Verify .gitignore includes personal files
   - [ ] Check README is clear for template users
   - [ ] Ensure example files are present

### Part 2: Set Up Private Personal Repository

1. **Navigate to your original ShellCV:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/amity/projects/ShellCV
   ```

2. **Ensure all personal data is committed:**
   ```bash
   git status
   git add .
   git commit -m "FINAL: Complete personal site with all data"
   ```

3. **Create new private GitHub repository:**
   - Go to github.com
   - Create new repository: `amityogev.com` or `amityogev-cv`
   - Make it **PRIVATE**
   - Don't initialize with README

4. **Update remote and push:**
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/broddo-baggins/amityogev.com.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

5. **Update links in personal repo to point to template:**
   
   **index.html:**
   ```html
   <footer class="page-footer">
       <p>source: <a href="https://github.com/your-username/shellcv-template">shellcv-template</a></p>
       <p>&copy; Amit Yogev - ShellCV 2025</p>
   </footer>
   ```
   
   Commit and push:
   ```bash
   git add index.html
   git commit -m "UPDATE: Point to public template repository"
   git push
   ```

6. **Verify private repo:**
   - [ ] Check GitHub - repository is private
   - [ ] Verify all your personal data is there
   - [ ] Verify ai-agent.js has your real resume data
   - [ ] Check assets/ has your real resume/skills/projects

### Part 3: Deploy Private Site to Vercel

1. **Connect Vercel:**
   - Go to vercel.com
   - Click "New Project"
   - Import from GitHub
   - Select your PRIVATE repository (`amityogev.com`)

2. **Configure:**
   ```
   Framework Preset: Other
   Build Command: (leave default)
   Output Directory: (leave empty)
   Install Command: npm install
   ```

3. **Add Environment Variables:**
   - `GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY`: your_actual_api_key
   - `NODE_ENV`: production

4. **Deploy:**
   - Click Deploy
   - Wait for completion
   - Test the deployed site

5. **Configure Custom Domain:**
   - Go to Project Settings â†’ Domains
   - Add `amityogev.com`
   - Update DNS records as instructed by Vercel
   - Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 48 hours)

6. **Verify deployment:**
   - [ ] Visit https://your-deployment.vercel.app
   - [ ] Test AI agent: type `ask who are you?`
   - [ ] Test resume command
   - [ ] Test game: type `play`
   - [ ] Test curl: `curl your-deployment.vercel.app`
   - [ ] Test custom domain (if configured)

## Post-Split Tasks

### Documentation Updates

In **Template Repo** (Public):
- [ ] Update README.md with clear template instructions
- [ ] Add contributing guidelines if accepting PRs
- [ ] Create GitHub issues templates
- [ ] Add LICENSE file (MIT recommended)
- [ ] Create CHANGELOG.md

In **Personal Repo** (Private):
- [ ] Update README.md to mention it's private
- [ ] Link to public template
- [ ] Document your deployment URL
- [ ] Add notes about personal customizations

### Testing Checklist

Test **Template Repo** locally:
```bash
cd shellcv-template
npm install
npm start
```
- [ ] Runs without errors (even without .env)
- [ ] Shows template placeholders
- [ ] Example files load correctly
- [ ] No personal data visible
- [ ] README instructions are clear

Test **Personal Site** (deployed):
- [ ] AI agent responds with your actual experience
- [ ] Resume shows your real data
- [ ] Skills show your technologies
- [ ] Projects show your portfolio
- [ ] Links go to your actual profiles
- [ ] Email is your real email
- [ ] Game works
- [ ] All commands function
- [ ] curl API works
- [ ] Mobile responsive
- [ ] No console errors

### Cleanup

- [ ] Delete old clones/copies used during split
- [ ] Update bookmarks to new repository URLs
- [ ] Update any documentation that referenced old repo
- [ ] Announce template availability (if desired)

## Ongoing Maintenance

### When You Update Your Resume:

```bash
cd /Users/amity/projects/ShellCV  # Your private repo
nano assets/resume.txt
nano ai-agent.js  # Update SYSTEM_CONTEXT if needed
git add .
git commit -m "UPDATE: Add new role and achievements"
git push
# Vercel auto-deploys
```

### When You Improve Template:

If you add a feature to your personal site that others could benefit from:

1. Extract the generic feature
2. Remove personal data
3. Test in template repo:
   ```bash
   cd ~/projects/shellcv-template
   # Add the feature
   git add .
   git commit -m "FEAT: Add new feature"
   git push
   ```

3. Pull into your personal site if needed:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/amity/projects/ShellCV
   git remote add template https://github.com/your-username/shellcv-template.git
   git fetch template
   git cherry-pick <commit-hash>  # Pick specific commits
   ```

## Rollback Plan

If something goes wrong during the split:

1. **Your original data is safe** - it's still in your current repo
2. **Template repo is new** - can delete and recreate
3. **No deployment yet** - no production impact

To rollback:
```bash
# Delete template attempt
cd ~/projects
rm -rf shellcv-template

# Your original is untouched at:
cd /Users/amity/projects/ShellCV

# Reset if needed
git reset --hard HEAD~1  # Goes back one commit
```

## Support & Questions

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check this checklist** - did you miss a step?
2. **Review DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md** - detailed deployment instructions
3. **Test locally first** - before deploying
4. **Check logs** - Vercel provides detailed error logs
5. **Git history** - you can always go back

## Success Indicators

You'll know the split was successful when:

âœ… Template repo is public on GitHub with no personal data
âœ… Personal repo is private on GitHub with all your data
âœ… Personal site is deployed to Vercel at your domain
âœ… AI agent knows your real resume and responds accurately
âœ… Template README clearly explains how others can use it
âœ… Both repos are independently maintained
âœ… You can pull template updates into your personal site

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours for complete split and deployment
