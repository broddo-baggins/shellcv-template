# ShellCV v1.0.3-EA - AI-Powered with Buttery Smooth Animations

## 🎉 Major Release Highlights

### 🤖 Meet Shell - Your AI Companion
Shell is now powered by **Google Gemini 2.0** (FREE tier) and knows everything about:
- Amit's 10+ year career across cybersecurity, Web3, and AI-powered SaaS
- Complete technical details of PM Quest game mechanics
- OvenAI CRM features, tech stack, and implementation
- How to build your own ShellCV in 2 minutes
- All terminal commands with helpful examples

**Persona**: Shell is a friendly, witty PM who became an AI. Casual but professional, helpful but never boring!

### 🎬 Animation Overhaul - No More Stuttering!
**Before**: 50ms setTimeout rendering = ~20fps (stuttery, jarring)
**After**: 15ms requestAnimationFrame = ~66fps (buttery smooth!)

Technical improvements:
- Eliminated stuttering using `requestAnimationFrame` (syncs with browser refresh rate)
- Optimized scrolling (every 2 lines vs every 3)
- Removed unreliable setTimeout in favor of RAF
- Frame-perfect timing for production-quality terminal experience

### 💬 UX Improvements
- ✅ Empty commands now work (like real terminals!)
- ✅ Enhanced AI responses with context awareness
- ✅ Robust fallback system (works even offline)
- ✅ Better error messaging and suggestions
